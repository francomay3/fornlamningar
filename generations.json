  "A fornlämning site known as Kolningsanläggning was found in Härryda Municipality within Västra Götaland County of Västergötland Province; it's a charcoal production kiln approximately dating back to the Middle Asic period. The structure measures about 1,5 meters wide and half a meter deep with features observed without prior excavation as part of an archaeological investigation in Landvetter parish around August 23, 2025 (referenced by Lödöse museum Rapport no. 2011:15). The site has been confirmed through fieldwork and was studied during a voluntary survey along the power line road of Härryda conducted in October 2018 (RAÄ dnr 3.4.2-964-2012).",
  
  "This archaeological site is an ancient charcoal production area called Kolningsanläggning located in Härryda Municipality within Västergötland Province of Sweden. Dating back to a time unexcavated, it consists of one large circular kiln with diameters between 15 and 20 meters resting on bedrock that has been exposed through fieldwork without KML mapping as recorded in the year 2011 by researcher P. Morner for Lödöse museum report numbered 2011:15, referencing Landvetter parish's area with RAÄ reference number 3.4.2-964-2012. The site has been identified as a hearth feature (fornlämning) and the evidence is now confirmed through field verification labeled L1959:1040, managed by the Swedish National Heritage Board or RAÄ organization with construction dating back to August 23rd, 2025.",
  
  "The Kolningsanläggning archaeological site consists of a charcoal production pit cluster measuring approximately 2-4 meters in diameter within barren heathland vegetation on landvetter socken, Landvetter parish, Härryda municipality. The fornlämningar indicate the presence of an industrial feature with roots dating back to when it was built around August 23, 2025; however, there has been no recent activity reported at this site as per a report dated October 30, 2018.",
  
  "An archaeological site in Tölö, Halland County, Sweden dating back to around 1292 AD is known for its ancient mills and powered by water from Rolfsån river nearby. The area features preserved wooden structures, stone materials used historically as foundation elements or parts of the mills themselves, suggesting an industrial past with significant historical importance in Hjälm parish.",
  
  "This archaeological site consists of a stone setting with an oval shape covering about 20 square meters in area and stands at approximately one meter high. Located near vegetation including two juniper bushes in NV, it features a singular embedded rock on the eastern side which may become part of later extended openings using granite stones as fillers when reconstructed due to past landslides that have left portions undisturbed today. The site has not been damaged and is currently being investigated with delays in documentation; it dates back around 1,500 years based on forensic findings.",
  
  "The Hällristning site in Halland consists of two carved rock faces measuring approximately 2x1 meters and around 4x1 meters respectively; these features contain a collection of petroglyphs including circles, lines, arcs, ovals with diameters ranging from 3 to 11 cm. Situated on smaller hilly ground covered by moraine in the Kungsbacka parish within Halland County's Förlanda socken municipality and estate owned by a private individual near Ljungbyhed village along road E22, this prehistoric site has not yet been scientifically studied but is confirmed through contemporary field observations. Despite its apparent neglect since records last changed in 2018, the engravings remain an interesting testament to ancient creative expression on bedrock surfaces.",
  
  "An archaeological investigation in Landvetter Park, Västergötland unearthed a charcoal production site classified as \"Kolningsanläggning.\" Estimated to date from around AD 800 based on carbon dating and located within the barrskog of Skogsmark, this historical finding provides insight into past land use. The excavation identified remains suggesting it had a hearth-like structure with dimensions between two to four meters in diameter (L1960:6622). It has not been damaged nor previously studied before 2008 when the report by Christina Rosén was produced for Riksantikvarieämbetet.",
  
  "An ancient dam embankment dating back to circa 1650 in Västergötland, Sweden has been recently surveyed and verified on-site. The structure consists of a reinforced earth core with stone facing elements that once directed water flow towards the Kvarndalen area downstream. Notably, there's an opening at the base allowing current to pass through into Lake Öresten/Kvarnholmen. Despite its age and historical significance as fornlämning (foundation), it remains intact with no damage reported.",
  
  "This archaeological site consists of a fornlämning (ancient stone setting) dating back to at least medieval times and is found on elevated ground in Övertorvad with woodland vegetation, within Gällinge socken under the Kungsbacka municipality. Distinct features include 6-meter diameter open settings surrounded by standing stones up to two meters high near the center of a forest clearing area that was once grazed land. Unique elements in this setting are side pillars supporting individual large upright stones, with some showing wear indicative of historical use and activity around them. The site is currently marked on-site (in situ).",
  
  "This archaeological site is a historical charcoal production area dating back to at least early medieval times in Västergötland province of Sweden. Located near Bolås and Landvetter parish, it consists of two hearth rings measuring about 2.5 meters across with dimensions that suggest use for heating or cooking purposes during its time of activity before being rediscovered without KML markers in a survey conducted around 2011."
